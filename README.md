Hypothetically, if someone made a video game that outlined enemies in a specific color, you could write a bot that scraped the screen in real time instead of looking at memory. 

This is an academic proof of concept. Dont use this live. 

## Running

go build && ./tyrande.exe

## OpenCV 

Download opencv and mingw, following installation instructions on github.


- Use 64 bit vc11 libs and dlls.
- Replace the version string in the include statements.
- Remove the .dll in the include statements
- Put the files in: C:\mingw\mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib
- Comment out method bodies in cvaux.go


Make sure the script compiles.

```
cd Documents\code\go\src\github.com\lazywei\go-opencv\samples && go run hellocv.go
```

### Profiling

Instructions taken from here: https://medium.com/@hackintoshrao/daily-code-optimization-using-benchmarks-and-profiling-in-golang-gophercon-india-2016-talk-874c8b4dc3c5#.wlwu2sxi8

Run profiling command:

```
go test -run=^$ -bench=. -cpuprofile=cpu.out
go tool pprof tyrande.test.exe cpu.out
web
```

```
go tool pprof tyrande.exe cpu.out
web
```
